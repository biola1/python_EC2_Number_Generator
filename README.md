# python_EC2_Number_Generator
python project
Python Is a general purpose  computer programming language that can be used to build office applications, internet applications or applications for companies. For example some well know products written in python includes Spotify, Dropbox. Data analyst and data scientist used python to analyse data, create report, work with artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Python is easier to learn compared to other programming languages. It Is an open source therefore making it free and very popular programming language. There are 2 versions of python. We have python 2 (older version)and python 3 (version). There are different Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write python code. We have the  Visual Studio Code(VS Code), AWS cloud9, Codespace by github, Jupyter Notebook and many more.

 For this project I used the AWS cloud 9 as my IDE . The project is that Several departments share an AWS environment. I need to ensure that the EC2s are properly named and are unique so team members can easily tell who the EC2 instances belong to. Use Python to create your unique EC2 names that the users can then attach to the instances.  The Python Script I created  
1. Allowed the user to input how many EC2 instances they want names for and output the same amount of unique names.
2. Allowed the user to input the name of their department that is used in the unique name.
3. Generate random characters and numbers that will be included in the unique name.

Make sure you set up your VPC, a public and private subnet in the same Availability zone before you create your cloud9 environment. For the VPC setting add the VPC and a private subnet you created.
